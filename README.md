With this challenge, I have decided to break it down to three major components. 
- Data Layer (Where Database (Data.json) interaction is happening)
- Service Layer (Where business Logic is being handled)
- Controller (Controller/url endpoint)

If this was something that used edmx, then I would have created another layer called Data Access Layer where all Db calls would have been defined.
